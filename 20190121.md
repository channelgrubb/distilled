## Articles of interest
 1. [Sante Fe institute on information theory, NN bottlenecking, compression, prediction](https://santafe.edu/news-center/news/information-theory-holds-surprises-machine-learning)
 
     **Summary/major finding**: 
        - multi-layer NN may not be trading prediction for compression in some cases (such as mutually exclusive classification problems , as argued in work by LINK? 
        - compression in an info theory sense doesn't map cleanly to classification class
 
     **So what?**: our understanding of compression-classification trades is still far from understood and there still seems to be plenty of daylight between human concept understanding and NN classification operations
 
2. [AlphaStar - DeepMind's winning attempt to defeat professional StarCraft players](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/)  

    **Summary/major finding**:  

    **So what?**: this agent displayed multiple skills thought to be difficult/impossible for machines to achieve: multiple, differing strategies; long-term planning; short-term tactical control of agents to achieve strategic goals  

3. [Fran√ßis Chollet on 'bias laundering' and 'responsible laundering' in ML systems](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1087867234775486464)

    **Summary/major finding**: algorithmic responsibility laundering and bias laundering
    
    **So what?**: ML and other mathematical modeling may diffuse, hide, or shift responsibility or bias that the model builders must account for. It is very similar to the ethical responsibilities that professional engineers carry when designing systems.

4. The limits of deep learning, synbolic representation, and the resurfacing of an AI tension that dates to the beginning of the field

	a. Some important recent papers and publications
		- [News Feature: What are the limits of deep learning?](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/4/1074)  
		- [Deep Learning: a Critical Appraisal - Gary Marcus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00631.pdf) 
		- [...Gary Marcus's medium post on the response to his 'Critical Appraisal' paper](https://medium.com/@GaryMarcus/in-defense-of-skepticism-about-deep-learning-6e8bfd5ae0f1)  
		
    **Summary/major finding**:
    
    **So what?**:

5. [Bayesian modeling applications to optimal supply chain deciison making](https://twiecki.io/blog/2019/01/14/supply_chain/)
    
    **Summary**: Thomas Twiecki, Bayesian methods advocate and PyMC3 developer, gives a an introducton to the value of information in a supply chain optimization problem.

    **So what?**: Traditional optimaztion methods, to the extent that they incorproate uncertainty, will often use expected values for key model parameters. But failing to account for uncertainty can lead to badly suboptimal results if actual values are even just slightly different from expected values. Bayesian models can help model important parameters and therefore improve decision-making. Other approaches from the operations research community include stochastic optimization and robust optimization methods. Bayesian models fit somewhere in the middle.
